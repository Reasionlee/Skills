Based on the Ramanujan Filter Banks (RFB) in the field of biological signal processing 

At present, a periodic estimation method in the field of biological signal processing is introduced into bearing fault diagnosis, and some improvements are made, and neural networks are designed according to the characteristics of this feature, and better diagnostic results are obtained.

- The Ph.D.'s original plan was to follow the current tutor' reading, so the pace of work was slower. The instructor used to do methodology, so hopefully I can use machine learning to open up new tracks in my application. The thesis is mainly guided by the tutor's sister-in-law, who is not much involved in the process. (Because force majeure tutors do not have places, so want to go abroad to read)
- Do a lot of useless work in the early stage, because everyone's thinking is constantly adjusting, such as starting to feel that some simple machine learning algorithms are OK, as long as the final result is good; So it took a long time to finish writing, and in the process stepped on a lot of pits, so that many algorithms are now at least no problem in their use.

- Proposed Scaled-RFB method based on the RFB and designed Strip-CNN to achieve better

  fault diagnosis performance than benchmarks in noisy environments

- Next will consider the anomaly detection when anomalous samples are absent, and deal with

  the presence of periodic noise (signal components have fluctuations in period)
